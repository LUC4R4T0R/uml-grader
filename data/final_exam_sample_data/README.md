# Sample Final Exam Question

## About exam question

This exam was for the [Winter 2020](https://github.com/ECSE321-Winter2017-McGill)
edition of ECSE223 Model-Based Programming course taught at
[McGill University](https://mcgill.ca/). The instructor was [Prof. Dániel Varró](https://github.com/varrodan).
The exam was held virtually on an exceptional basis, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which meant all submissions were made electronically.

The instructions require students to specify a domain model for a smart home automation system (SHAS). Students are expected to describe all
domain concepts and their relationships in an Umple domain model.

In this work, we ignore the grading items related to best practices, since grading them cannot be easily automated.
